# Louisville Resist

This is a resource only for local Louisville activism centered around but never limited to these important issues:

* Ending Violence
* Reproductive Rights
* LGBTQIA Rights
* Worker's Rights
* Civil Rights
* Disability Rights
* Immigrant Rights
* Environmental Justice

(I recommend reading the [principles page on Women's March](https://www.womensmarch.com/principles) for more on each issue listed here.)

## How to help

1. Participate in an event
2. Call your representitives
3. Submit content to this site


### Warning: don't edit any `.html` files

Make your changes in `source/data` or `sources/templates`.
The html files are created by a build script that smashes everything from the `source/data` folder into templates located in `sources/templates`.
This type of site is known as statically generated, and that has the advantage that it can't be easily hacked because there is no database.
